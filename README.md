# Franchise Expansion Project 

1. Overview
In today's competitive business landscape, strategic expansion is essential for the success of franchises. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to perform a comprehensive market analysis of a specific city. The analysis helps assess the market's potential and identify the target customer base, leading to informed decisions on the optimal locations for new franchise outlets.

2. Project Objectives
Market Analysis: Using machine learning algorithms, we conduct a detailed analysis of the city's market to identify key factors influencing franchise success.
Target Customer Identification: We identify the target customer base using data-driven insights, enabling us to tailor our offerings to the right audience.
Site Selection: We use machine learning to find the most optimal locations for new franchise outlets, focusing on maximizing profitability while minimizing risks.

3. Machine Learning Techniques
This project employs the following machine learning algorithms:
   a) Random Forest: Used for predicting the success of potential locations based on various market factors.
   b) K-Means Clustering: Used for segmenting the customer base into different groups, helping to identify the target customers.
   c) Linear Regression: Applied to forecast future sales growth and market trends in the selected locations.
